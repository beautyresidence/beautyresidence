        <h2>The excellent line of PDRN-injectables with an anti-aging effect</h2>

        <p>Juvenus must be used as a temporary filler to correct small skin defects.</p>
        <p>Thanks to its biochemical properties, the product increases skin elasticity and is effective against signs of aging and photoaging such as wrinkles, loss of skin firmness, loss of tone and elasticity, lip atrophy (loss of lip volume). It is also effective in the treatment of fibrous tissues such as scars. </p>
        <p>The polynucleotide chain binds water molecules, acts as an anti-radical scavenger, and serves as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals (OH) that accumulate under stress or due to foreign agents such as UV radiation. </p>
        <p>Its hydration and anti-radical activity help create an optimal environment for fibroblast growth, thereby restoring tissue elasticity.  </p>
